<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The projects is an anlaysis of the Gitcoin GR15 Beta round. The aim of this analysis is to validate useful methods used to spot Fraudulent Grants/ projects. For this project I made use of two different python packages which are novel to analyzing Grants. They are:
  
  1. HTML Date 
  2. TextBlob
  
  * HTML Date: 
  The htmldate package is primarily designed to parse and extract the date from HTML content, specifically focusing on the <meta> tags and other relevant HTML elements where the creation or modification  date of a webpage might be specified. The package can be useful in extracting certain date-related information from HTML content, it's important to note that it relies on the presence and accuracy of such information within the HTML structure of a webpage. Using this package would give a near accurate estimate of when the website was created or last or last modified.
  
 * TextBlob
  TextBlob is a Python library that provides a simple API for common natural language processing tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, and more. One of the features TextBlob offers is the ability to analyze the subjectivity of a given text.

Subjectivity is a measure of how subjective or opinion-based a piece of text is, as opposed to being objective and fact-based. Subjectivity scores range from 0 (completely objective) to 1 (completely subjective).
